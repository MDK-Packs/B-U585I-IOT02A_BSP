This is an Virtual COM example that demonstrates Communication Device Class (CDC)
Abstract Control Model (ACM) on USB Device.

It demonstrates a bridge between USB Virtual COM Port and UART port on the
evaluation board.

Board:                          STM         'B-U585I-IOT02A'
Microcontroller:                STM         'STM32U585AII6QU'
Clock Settings:                 CPU clock    160 MHz
                                USB clock     48 MHz
USB Full-speed:                 OTG_FS (connector CN1 - USB Type-C)
Bridge functionality:           OTG_FS (connector CN1 - USB Type-C) <-> USART1 (STLink Virtual COM - connector CN8)

Newer versions of Microsoft Windows will automatically install Virtual COM Port
with the name "USB Serial Device (COMx)".
On older Microsoft Windows or also on newer you can install the driver
b-u585i-iot02a-vcom.cat, found in project root, manually.
If the driver is manually installed the Virtual COM Port name will change to
"B-U585I-IOT02A USB VCOM Port (COMx)", it can be found under
System/Hardware/Device Manager/Ports(COM&LPT).
Number "x" is not fixed as different PC configuration may have different
"x" displayed in the device manager. The USB Host driver assigns "x"
dynamically based on the existing COM port configuration in the system.

Testing the USB Virtual COM Port:

  Connect USB Host PC with USB cable to USB-STLINK (CN8) connector on the embedded board.
  Connect USB Host PC with USB cable to OTG_FS (Type-C CN1) connector on the embedded board.
  Open two Serial Terminal applications in the Microsoft Windows:
    -  one with "USB Serial Device (COMx)" or "B-U585I-IOT02A USB VCOM Port (COMx)"
    -  one with "STMicroelectronics STLink Virtual COM Port (COMy)" (retargeted USART1)
  Data sent from one Serial Terminal application should be received in the other and vice versa.

The program is available in different targets:
